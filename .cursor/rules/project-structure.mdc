# Project Structure

## Directory Organization:
- **LogOutput**: Container for log output related exercises
- **TheProject**: Main application project folder
- Keep each project in its own directory
- Store Kubernetes manifests in `manifests/` subdirectory within each project
- Place Dockerfiles in the root of each project directory

## File Naming Conventions:
- Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for files and directories)
- Group related files together logically
- Keep configuration files organized in appropriate subdirectories
- Use descriptive file names that indicate their purpose

## Documentation Structure:
- Include project-specific README.md files in subdirectories
- Maintain root README.md with exercise links
- Document deployment steps and requirements
- Include example commands for building and running

## File Management:
- Use proper .gitignore patterns
- Keep related files grouped together
- Maintain clean and organized directory structure
- Remove unnecessary or temporary files
