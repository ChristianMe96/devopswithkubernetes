# Exercise Completion Workflow

## Course: https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-kubernetes

### MANDATORY Requirements:
- **Every completed exercise/task must be tagged with a release number** (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
- **Update the root README.md with the new release and path to the updated project folder**
- **Use semantic versioning format**: `[exercise_number]` (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
- **Include descriptive commit messages that reference the exercise number**
- **Test the solution before creating the tag**
- **Each release should point to the specific project folder that was updated** (LogOutput, TheProject, etc.)

### README.md Maintenance:
- Always update the root README.md when completing an exercise
- Use the format: `- [exercise_number](https://github.com/ChristianMe96/devopswithkubernetes/tree/[tag]/[ProjectFolder])`
- Link should point to the specific project folder that contains the exercise solution
- Keep entries in chronological order
- Include clear chapter headings to organize exercises

### Quality Assurance:
- Test thoroughly before considering an exercise complete
- Validate solutions work as expected
- Review logs for errors or warnings
- Only create tags for completed, working exercises
