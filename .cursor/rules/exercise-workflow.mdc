# Exercise Completion Workflow

## Course: https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-kubernetes

### MANDATORY Requirements:
- **Every completed exercise/task must be tagged with a release number** (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
- **Update the root README.md with the new release and path to the updated project folder**
- **Use semantic versioning format**: `[exercise_number]` (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
- **Include descriptive commit messages that reference the exercise number**
- **MANDATORY: Test the solution thoroughly before creating the tag**
- **Each release should point to the specific project folder that was updated** (LogOutput, TheProject, etc.)

### README.md Maintenance:
- Always update the root README.md when completing an exercise
- Use the format: `- [exercise_number](https://github.com/ChristianMe96/devopswithkubernetes/tree/[tag]/[ProjectFolder])`
- Link should point to the specific project folder that contains the exercise solution
- Keep entries in chronological order
- Include clear chapter headings to organize exercises

### Quality Assurance (MANDATORY):
- **Test thoroughly before considering an exercise complete**
- **Build and test Docker images locally**
- **Deploy to k3d cluster and verify functionality**
- **Test all endpoints and expected behaviors**
- **Check application logs for errors or warnings**
- **Validate Kubernetes manifests with dry-run**
- **Verify Ingress/Service accessibility**
- **Only create tags for completed, working exercises**
- **Never skip testing - untested code should not be tagged**
