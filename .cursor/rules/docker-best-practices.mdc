# Docker Best Practices

## Dockerfile Guidelines:
- Use specific base image versions, avoid `latest`
- Implement multi-stage builds when appropriate
- Minimize the number of layers in Dockerfiles
- Use COPY instead of ADD unless specific functionality is needed
- Add proper labels for metadata and versioning
- Minimize image layers and size

## Security Considerations:
- Use non-root users when possible
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regularly update dependencies and base images
- Never include secrets in Docker images

## File Management:
- Create .dockerignore files to exclude unnecessary files
- Keep Dockerfiles in the root of each service directory
- Use meaningful and descriptive image names and tags

## Testing:
- Test Docker containers locally before committing
- Verify containers work as expected in isolation
- Check for any runtime errors or warnings
